Database that includes all the game data in SQL form alongside some analytics like graphs for the ingame assets of the discontinued total conversion mod - GTA Underground 

GTA Underground is a total conversion mod for Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas that re-unites all of Rockstar's 3D Era games into one big sandbox experience. It adds brand new vehicles, weapons, player skins, cities, custom weathers and a lot more on top of a brand new multiplayer client and custom content made by the modding community's finest content creators. The latest version released is GTA: Underground 4.2 before being discontinued due to Take Two interactive war on singleplayer modding, however the mod itself can still be played and its multiplayer variant is still working.
