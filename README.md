Database that includes all the data of the discontinued total conversion mod - GTA Underground

GTA Underground is a total conversion mod for Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas that re-unites all of Rockstar's 3D Era games into one big sandbox experience. It adds brand new vehicles, weapons, player skins, cities, custom weathers and a lot more on top of a brand new multiplayer client and custom content made by the modding community's finest modders. The latest version released is GTA: Underground 4.2 before being discontinued due to Take Two's interactive crack down on singleplayer modders, however the mod can still be played and its multiplayer variant is still working.
